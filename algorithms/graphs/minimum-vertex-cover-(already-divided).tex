\subsection{Minimum Vertex Cover (already divided)}

Given a bipartite graph $g$ with $n$ vertices at left and $m$ vertices at right, where $g[i]$ are the possible right side matches of vertex $i$ from left side, find a minimum vertex cover. The size is the same as the size of the maximum matching, and the complement is a maximum independent set.
