\subsection{Biconnected Components}

Build a vector of vectors, where the i-th vector correspond to the nodes of the i-th biconnected component, a biconnected component is a subset of nodes and edges in which there is no cut point, also exist at least two distinct routes in vertex between any two vertex in the same biconnected component.
