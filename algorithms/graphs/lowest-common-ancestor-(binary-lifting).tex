\subsection{Lowest Common Ancestor (Binary Lifting)}

given a directed tree, finds the LCA between two nodes using binary lifting, and answer a few queries with it.

lca: returns the LCA between the two given nodes

on\_path: fids if $c$ is in the path from $a$ to $b$

Time: build $O(N \cdot MAXLOG2)$ all queries $O(MAXLOG2)$
