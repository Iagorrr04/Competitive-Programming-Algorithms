\subsection{Maximum Flow (Dinic)}

Finds the \textbf{maximum flow} in a graph network, given the \textbf{source $s$} and the \textbf{sink $t$}. Add edge from $a$ to $b$ with capcity $c$.

Complexity: time in general $O(E \cdot V^2)$, if every capacity is 1, and every vertice has in degree equal 1 or out degree equal 1 then $O(E \cdot \sqrt{V})$,

Suffle the edges list for every vertice may take you out of the worst case
