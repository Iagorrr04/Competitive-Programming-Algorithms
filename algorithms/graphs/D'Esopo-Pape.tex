\subsection {D`Escopo-Pape}

Is a single source shortest path that works faster than Dijkstra's algorithm and the Bellman-Ford algorithm in most cases, and will also work for negative edges. However not for negative cycles. There exists cases where it runs in exponential time.

Returns a pair containing two vectors, the first one with the distance from $s$ to every other node, and another one with the ancestor of each node, note that the ancestor of $s$ is $-1$
