\subsection{Disjoint Edges Path (Maxflow)}

Given a directed graph find's every path with distinct edges that starts at $s$ and ends at $t$


\hl{When building the graph, if there is an edge $(u, v)$ is necessary to also add the transposed edge $(v, u)$ but only need to add the capacity $c(u, v)$, and mark $isedge(u,v)$ as true.}

Time : $O(E \cdot V^2) $
