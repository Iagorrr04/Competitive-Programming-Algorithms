\subsection {Dijkstra}

Finds the shortest path from $ s $ to every other node, and keep the 'parent' tracking. recover\_path, receives the $ ps $ generated by dijkstra and finds the shortest path from source to ending. Works with both undirected and directed graphs, multiedges, loops and negative edges, except when there is a negative cycle !

Time: $O(E \cdot \log{V})$
