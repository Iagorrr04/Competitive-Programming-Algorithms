\subsection{Find Bridges}

Find every bridge in a \textbf{undirected} connected graph.

\textbf{bridge: }  A bridge is defined as an \textbf{edge} which, when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph. 

\hl{ Remember to read the graph as pair where the second is the id of the edge !}

Time: $O(N+M)$
