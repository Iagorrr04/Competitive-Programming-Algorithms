\subsection{Minimum Cost Flow}

Given a network find the minimum cost to achieve a flow of at most $f$. Works with \textbf{directed} and \textbf{undirected} graphs


\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{add(u, v, w, c):} adds an edge from $u$ to $v$ with capacity $w$ and cost $c$.
  \item \textbf{flow(s, t, f):} return a pair $(flow, cost)$ with the maximum flow until $f$ with source at $s$ and sink at $t$, with the minimum cost possible.
\end{itemize}

Time : $O(N \cdot M + f \cdot m \log{n})$
