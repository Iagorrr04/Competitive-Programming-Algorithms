\subsection{Find Articulation/Cut Points}

Given an \textbf{undirected} graph find it's articulation points.

\textbf{articulation point (or cut vertex):} is defined as a \textbf{vertex} which, when removed along with associated edges, increases thee number of connected components in the graph.

\hl{A vertex $u$ can be an articulation point if and only if has at least 2 adjascent vertex}

Time: $O(N+M)$
