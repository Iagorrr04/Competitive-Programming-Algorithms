\subsection{Maximum Flow (Edmonds-Karp)}

Finds the \textbf{maximum flow} in a graph network, given the \textbf{source $s$} and the \textbf{sink $t$}.

\hl{When building the graph, if there is an edge $(u, v)$ is necessary to also add the transposed edge $(v, u)$ but only need to add the capacity $c(u, v)$.}

Time: $O(V \cdot E^2)$
