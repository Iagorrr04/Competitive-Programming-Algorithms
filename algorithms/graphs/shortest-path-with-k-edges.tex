\subsection{Shortest Path With K-edges}

Given an adjacency matrix of a graph, and a number $K$ computes the shortest path between all nodes that uses exactly $K$ edges, so for $0 \leq i, j \leq N-1$ ans[i][j] = "the shortest path between $i$ and $j$ that uses exactly $K$ edges, remember to initialize the adjacency matrix with $\infty$.

time : $O(N^3 \cdot \log{K})$
