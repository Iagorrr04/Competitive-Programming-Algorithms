\subsection{Polyminoes}

$buildPolyminoes(x)$ creates every polymino of until size x, and put it in $polyminoes[x]$, access $polymino.v$ to find theas vector of pairs representing the coordinates of each piece, if the polymino was 'rooted' in coordinate $(0,0)$, note that when acessing $polyminoes[x]$ only the first $x$ coordinates are valid.
