\subsection{Chinese Remainder Theorem}

Finds the solution $x$  to the $n$ modular equations.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    x \equiv a_1 (mod m_1) \\ 
    ... \\
    x \equiv a_n (mod m_n)
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}



The $m_i$ don't need to be coprime, if there is no solution then it returns -1.
