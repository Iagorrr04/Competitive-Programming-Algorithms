\subsection{Polyminoes}

$buildPolyominoes(x)$ creates every polyomino until size x, and put it in $polyominoes[x]$, access $polyomino.v$ to find theas vector of pairs representing the coordinates of each piece, considering that the polyomino was 'rooted' in coordinate $(0,0)$, note that when acessing $polyominoes[x]$ only the first $x$ coordinates are valid.
