\subsection{Closest value greater than}

This structure allows you to answer the closest value to the position $i$ that is greater than $xs_i$, the answer is given as a pair $(l,r)$ is the position of the closest greater value to the the left and right respectively, both can be $-1$ if there is no such value. Build it with the size of the vector or the vector itself.
