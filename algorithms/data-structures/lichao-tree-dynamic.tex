\subsection{Lichao Tree (dynamic)}

Lichao Tree that creates the nodes dynamically, allowing to query and update from range $\[MAXL, MAXR\]$
$query(x)$ : find the highest point among all lines in the structure

$add(a, b)$ : add a line of form $y = ax + b$ in the structure

$addSegment(a, b, l, r)$ : add a line segment of form $y = ax + b$ which covers from range $\[l, r\]$

time: $O(\log{N})$
