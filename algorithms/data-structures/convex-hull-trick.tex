\subsection{Convex Hull Trick / Line Container}

Container where you can add lines of the form $mx + b$ , and query maximum value at point $x$.

$insert\_line(m, b)$ inserts the line $m \cdot x + b$ in the container.

$eval(x)$ find the highest value among all lines in the point $x$.

both in $O(\log{N})$
