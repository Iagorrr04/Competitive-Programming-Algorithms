\subsection{Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)}


Find the pair $(sz, psx)$ where $sz$ is the size of the longest subsequence and $psx$ is a vector where $psx_i$ tells the size of the longest increase subsequence that ends at position $i$. $get_idx$ just tells which indices could be in the longest increasing subsequence.

Time: $O(n\log{n})$
