\subsection{Binary Knapsack (bottom up)}

Given $N$ items, each with its own value $V_i$ and weight $W_i$ and a maximum knapsack weight $W$, compute the maximum value of the items that we can carry, if we can either ignore or take a particular item. Assume that $1 \leq n \leq 1000$, $1 \leq S \leq 10 000$.

Time and space: $O(N*W)$

\hl{the vectors $VS$ and $WS$ starts at one, so it need an empty value at indes 0.}
