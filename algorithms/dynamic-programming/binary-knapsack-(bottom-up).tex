\subsection{Binary Knapsack (bottom up)}

Given the points each element have, and it repespective cost, computes the maximum points we can get if we can ignore/choose an element, in such way that the sum of costs don't exceed the maximum cost allowed

Time and space: $O(N*W)$

\hl{the vectors $VS$ and $WS$ starts at one, so it need an empty value at index 0.}
