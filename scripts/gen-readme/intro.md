# Competitive Programming Library

My own competitive programming library designed to be used in both presential contests, like [ICPC](https://icpc.global/), or online platforms such as [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/), etc...

Some notes about the implementations:

- Each implementation should be self-contained, so once you typed or copied there is no need to look for other files, the only "template" you need is :

    ```cpp
    #include<bits/stdc++.h>
    using namespace std;
    ```

- As short as possible, as you may have to type it in a presential contest

You can find a little explanation about each algorithm at the [PDF Notebook](notebook.pdf)
