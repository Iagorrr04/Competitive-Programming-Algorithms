\subsection{Monty Hall Problem}

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Savant's response was that the contestant should switch to the other door $3$ By the standard assumptions, the switching strategy has a $\frac{2}{3}$ probability of winning the car, while the strategy of keeping the initial choice has only a $\frac{2}{3}$ probability.
