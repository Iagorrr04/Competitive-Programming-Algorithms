\subsection{Centroid}

A  centroid of a tree is defined as a node such that when the tree is rooted at it, no other nodes have a subtree of size greater than $\frac{N}{2}$.

Every tree have a centroid.

\subsection{Centroid decomposition}

The centroid decomposition of a tree is another tree defined recursively as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Its root is the centroid of the original tree.
  \item Its children are the centroid of each tree resulting from the removal of the centroid from the original tree.
\end{itemize}

Properties:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A vertex belongs to the component of all its ancestors.
\end{itemize}
