\subsection{Line}

\subsubsection{General equation}

\begin{equation}
    ax + by + c = 0
\end{equation}

Note that a same line can have multiple representations (just multiply the equation by any real number), so to make each line have a single equation divide everyhting by $a$, or $b$ if $a$ is zero.

\subsubsection{General equation from two points}

Let $P$ and $Q$ be the points that define the line.

\[
  \begin{array}{l}
  a = P_y - Q_y \\
  b = Q_x-P_x  \\
  c = P \times Q = P_x Q_y - P_y Q_x \\
  \end{array}
\]


\subsubsection{Line inclination from two points}

Let $P$ and $Q$ be two points that belongs to the line, such that $P_x < Q_x$ the inclination $m$ or angular coefficient is given by:

\begin{equation}
    m = \frac{Q_y - P_y}{Q_x - P_x}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Check if a point belongs to the line}

Let $r$ be a line such that $ax + by + c = 0$ and $P$ a point. $P \in r$ if and only if :

\[
  a P_x + b P_y + c = 0
\]

\subsubsection{Distance from a point to a line}

The distance from a point $P$ and a line $r$ is defined as the shortest distance possible between every point that belongs to $r$ and $P$. Such distance will be the distance from $P$ and the intersection between $r$ and the orthogonal projection from $P$ to $r$, and can be found by:


\[
    \frac{|a P_x + b P_y +c|}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}
\]

The coordinates of the point $Q$ are given by:

\[
  \begin{array}{c}
    Q_x = \frac{b (b P_x - a P_y)-ac}{a^2+b^2} \\
    Q_y = \frac{a(-bP_x+aP_y)-bc}{a^2+b^2} \\
  \end{array}
\]
