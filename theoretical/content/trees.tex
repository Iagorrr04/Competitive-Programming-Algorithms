\subsection{Heavy-Light Decomposition}
Heavy-Light Decomposition (HLD) is a technique to decompose a tree into a set of disjoint paths. This technique is particularly useful to deal with problems which require us to do some path-queries in a tree which seemingly complicated but easy enough to be solved for a line-graph. The idea is to decompose the tree into several paths (line-graph) of disjoint vertices. Then, each path-query in the original tree might be able to be answered by queries in one or more of those paths.

An edge (a, b) is heavy if and only if size(b)
size(a)/2; otherwise, it is light
