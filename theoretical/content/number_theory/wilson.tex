\subsection{Wilson's theorem}

Wilson's theorem states that a natural number $n > 1$ is a \textbf{prime number} if and only if the product of all the positive integers less than n is one less than a multiple of n.

That is :

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c}
    (n-1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{n}
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

In other words, any integer $n > 1$ is a prime number if, and only if, $(n − 1)! + 1 $is divisible by $n$
