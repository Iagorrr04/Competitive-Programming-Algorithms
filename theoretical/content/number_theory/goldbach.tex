\subsection{Goldbach's Conjecture}

"Every pair number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes"

Valid for every integer in range from $4$ to $10^{18}$, but without proof

For an odd $x$ number it can be written as the sum of two primes if $x - 2$ is also prime, or three primes, $3$ and the two primes that results in $x-3$.
